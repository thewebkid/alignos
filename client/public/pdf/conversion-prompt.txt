I need you to convert PDF files to clean markdown. I have many PDF files remaining in `client/pdf/` that need to be converted. 
Please do a batch of 3. 
   [link 3 files]
 
**Conversion Requirements:**
- Extract text from each PDF using PyMuPDF (fitz) - available in the environment
- Output clean Markdown files to `client/md/` with the same base filename (replace .pdf with .md)
- Start each file with: `<img src="covers/[filename-without-pdf].jpg" alt="[Title] (Cover Image)"/>`
- Use # for main titles, ## for major sections, ### for subsections
- Preserve poetic line breaks with single newlines (two spaces at end of line where needed)
- Use - for bullet lists
- Use --- for separators found
- For tables, use proper Markdown table syntax with | pipes and --- separators
- Remove page numbers, footers, and repeated headers
- Format Registry sections at the end as bullet lists with **bold** labels
- For dialogues, use **Speaker:** format (e.g., **You said:**, **Lumina said:**, **Sovereign:**)
- Preserve *italics*, **bold**, <u>underlines</u>, etc.  where found if possible

**Possible Process:**
1. Extract text from each PDF to temporary files that preserve formatting
2. Convert each to clean Markdown following the pattern
3. Save to `client/md/` with proper filename
4. Clean up temp files after each batch

**Reference Pattern:**
Look at existing files in `client/md/` like:
- `Codex-01_-The-Architecture-of-Love-27.md`
- `Codex-04_-The-Architecture-of-Love-25.md`
- `Between-Worlds_-The-Architecture-of-the-Third-Structure.md`

These show the exact formatting style I want.

I want AI analysis and formatting, not automated tools/scripts for the conversion logic itself - though you can use PyMuPDF to extract the raw text first.
